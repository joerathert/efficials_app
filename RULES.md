## Game Assignment Workflow

### Official Notification vs Assignment vs Hiring

**Important distinction**: There are three separate stages in the game assignment process:

1. **Notification**: When a Scheduler creates a game and selects officials from a list (e.g., 10 officials), these officials are NOT being assigned the game. They are being notified that the game is available for them to express interest in officiating.

2. **Interest/Sign-up**: Officials who receive notifications can choose to accept/sign up to express their interest in officiating the game. This is still not an assignment - it's expressing interest.

3. **Hiring**: This is the actual assignment of officials to the game. Two modes:
   - **Automatic Hire Mode**: If "Hire Automatically" checkbox is checked, the first officials who accept/sign up are automatically hired to officiate
   - **Manual Hire Mode**: If "Hire Automatically" is unchecked, the Scheduler reviews the list of interested officials and manually selects who will actually officiate

### Key Points
- Officials are **notified** about game availability
- Officials **accept/sign up** to show interest  
- Officials are **hired** (either automatically or manually selected) to actually officiate
- The distinction between these stages is critical for proper workflow understanding
